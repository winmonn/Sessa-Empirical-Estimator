Assignment 2: Clustering with Sessa Empirical Estimator
Overview
This assignment focuses on implementing the Sessa Empirical Estimator for clustering. We will convert existing R code to Python, apply it to real-world or simulated datasets, and compare different clustering techniques to evaluate their effectiveness.

Instructions
1. Research & Understanding
Read journal articles about the Sessa Empirical Estimator to understand its methodology and applications.
2. Code Conversion
Convert the existing R code to Python using Jupyter Notebook.
3. Data Selection & Preprocessing
Use either:
Simulated data: Frontiers in Pharmacology Dataset
Real-world dataset: Available on Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository
Perform the Sessa Empirical Estimator on the chosen dataset and generate insights.
4. Experiment with Alternative Clustering Algorithms
The Sessa Empirical Estimator primarily uses K-Means clustering.
Implement an alternative clustering algorithm (e.g., DBSCAN, Agglomerative Clustering, or Gaussian Mixture Models) and analyze the differences.
5. Compare & Analyze Results
Evaluate results from K-Means vs. the alternative algorithm.
Identify strengths and weaknesses of each clustering method.
